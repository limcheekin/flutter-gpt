      "5) What is the difference between stateful and stateless widgets?\n",
      "A stateful widget is a widget that contains mutable state, i.e., data that can change over time. A stateless widget, on the other hand, is a widget that does not contain any mutable state and is purely based on its input parameters.\n",
      " Stateless widgets are created by the framework and don’t have a build method. They are used to create simple user interfaces that don’t need to be built or reused.

      "8) How do I handle async operations in Flutter?\n",
      "In Flutter, you can use the async and await keywords to handle async operations. You can use the Future class to represent a value or error that may be available at some point in the future, and use async functions to wait for these values.\n",
      " You can use the asynchronous facilities that the Dart language provides, such as async/await, to perform asynchronous work. You might be familiar with the asynchronous paradigm if you’ve used it in C#, Javascript, or if you have used Kotlin’s coroutines. For example, you can run network code without causing the UI to hang by using async/await and letting Dart do the heavy lifting: Once the awaited network call is done, update the UI by calling setState(), which triggers a rebuild of the widget sub-tree and updates the data. The following example loads data asynchronously and displays it in a ListView: Refer to the next section for more information on doing work in the background, and how Flutter differs from Android. Moving to the background thread Since Flutter is single threaded and runs an event loop (like Node.js), you don’t have to worry about thread management or spawning background threads. If you’re doing I/O-bound work, such as disk access or a network call, then you can safely use async/await and you’re done. If, on the other hand, you need to do computationally intensive work that keeps\n",

      "9) What is a FutureBuilder in Flutter?\n",
      "A FutureBuilder is a widget in Flutter that makes it easy to build UIs that depend on asynchronous data. It takes a Future as input and rebuilds itself whenever the future completes with either a value or an error.\n",
      " A FutureBuilder is a widget that builds itself based on the latest snapshot of interaction with a Future.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n",

      "services like rendering surfaces, accessibility, and input; and manages the\n",
      "message event loop. The embedder is written in a language that is appropriate\n",
      "for the platform: currently Java and C++ for Android, Objective-C/Objective-C++\n",
      "for iOS and macOS, and C++ for Windows and Linux. Using the embedder, Flutter\n",
      "code can be integrated into an existing application as a module, or the code may\n",
      "be the entire content of the application. Flutter includes a number of embedders\n",
      "for common target platforms, but other embedders also\n",
